  <p class='text'>The sea is lapping just by your feet, a warm breeze whips the tablecloth around your legs 
	  and a steamy pan of paella sits in front of you. Shrimp, lobster, mussels and cuttlefish combine 
	  with white rice and various herbs, oil and salt in this Valencian dish to send you immediately into holiday mode. 
	  Though if you have it in Spain, you're probably there already.</p>

     <p class='text'>So, who's up for a chunk of monkfish liver with a little grated daikon on the side? 
	     No? You're missing out on one of sushi's last great secrets, the prized ankimo. 
	     The monkfish/anglerfish that unknowingly bestows its liver upon upscale sushi fans is threatened by 
	     commercial fishing nets damaging its habitat, 
	     so it's possible ankimo won't be around much longer.

      <p class='text'>This premium Japanese Wagyu beef from famed Takara Ranch has been recognized 
	      by the Imperial Palace of Japan as one of the greatest beef stocks to be raised in the past 400 years. 
	      Called the "Rolls-Royce" of beef, it's best eaten sashimi style, anointed with a drizzle of kaffir lime and green tea sea salt. Marbled fat gives each mouthful texture, leaving a distinctly classic beef flavor.
